# ðŸ“š Library Management System (Console-Based)

### Overview
Welcome to the **Library Management System**, a basic console-based application built using Java. This system is designed to help manage library tasks such as book management, user registration, and book lending. It operates purely through the console, making it a simple and lightweight solution for small libraries or educational purposes.

This project uses **ArrayLists** to manage data in memory, without the need for databases or graphical interfaces. Itâ€™s perfect for those who want a hands-on understanding of library systems without diving into complex tech stacks.

### Features
- **Book Management**: 
  - Add new books.
  - Borrow books.
  - Return books.
  - Search for books by title or author or genre.
  - View most popular books.
  - Display all books,borowed books etc.
    
- **User Management**:
  - Register users (members of the library).
  - View user borrowing history.
- **Borrowing System**:
  - Issue books to users.
  - Return books and update their status.
- **Inventory Management**:
  - Check which books are available or currently borrowed.

### Getting Started
